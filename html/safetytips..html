4. Encourage reporting of accidents and near-misses: Employees should be encouraged to report accidents and near-misses without fear of discrimination or punishment. A reporting system should be established to collect and analyze the data, and appropriate actions should be taken to address the issues identified.

5. Promote a positive safety culture: Promote a positive safety culture by rewarding and recognizing employees who have contributed to safety improvements.
