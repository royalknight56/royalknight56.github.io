3. Communicating with stakeholders: Effective communication is vital in any organization, and managers play a crucial role in keeping all stakeholders informed about the project’s progress, including the team, stakeholders, and上级管理层. They must be able to articulate the vision and mission of the organization clearly and inspire employees to work towards the same.

4. Monitoring and evaluating performance: A manager needs to monitor the work progress and evaluate the performance of team members to ensure that they are working effectively. They must establish clear performance metrics and provide constructive feedback to help team members improve.

5. Delegating tasks and responsibilities:经理需要将适当的任务和责任分配给合适的团队成员,确保每个成员都明确自己的职责。这样可以提高工作效率,确保整个团队能够朝着共同的目标前进。

6. Providing support and resources: A good manager supports their team members by providing them with the necessary resources, training, and tools to perform their duties effectively. They must be approachable, open to feedback, and willing to assist team members whenever needed.

7. Ensuring legal and ethical practices: Managers must ensure that their team adheres to all relevant laws, regulations, and ethical standards. They must also promote a culture of transparency, fairness, and accountability within the organization.
